## Introduction


With a efficient technology we can definitely save millions of lives through organ donation and distribution. By using Life Vest Dapp the importance of the absence of third-party involvement in a process that is so delicate is achieved. The usage of a decentralized platform and implementation of blockchain along with smart contracts guarantees both security and synchronization which has been implemented efficiently.

Life Vest is implemented via a web portal that connects organ donors with organ receivers and administered by Organisations. We strive to completely avoid third-party interference and protecting the integrity of the patient data and identification of the donated organs. 

Through Life Vest the system is synchronized and the request for any particular organ of the specified blood type will be catered at the earliest. As soon as a request is put forth the availability is checked and the arrangement for the transfer of the organ is made. Using this organ type that the patient in need is supposed to receive and the specified blood group, the demand is generated. Upon receiving the details of any such donor the Organisation will be notified. Thus using this whole mechanism the organ to be donated can reach the recipient at the earliest possible time for successful and secure transplantation.
